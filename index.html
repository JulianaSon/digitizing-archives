<h1>Data Mining the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) Court Transcripts</h1>
<img src="images/HUAC.png"/>
<p> The HUAC records, composed of hundreds of hearings and over tens of thousands of pages from 1938-1975, represent one of the most substantive and largest collections of 20th century American political and social history. The records provide primary source material on American Cold War history and a unique account of government responses to real and perceived political dissent at key moments in American history.</p>
<p>Not only do we plan to make these important historical documents available to the public, but we will also provide an interface that will make the documents searchable and usable for research.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our project goals include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>extracting full-text from the scanned documents</li>
	<li>XML tagging of the documents</li>
	<li>API development so the user can feed the documents into a topic modeling tool, such as Mallet</li>
</ul>
