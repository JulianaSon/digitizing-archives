						<h2>March 8, 2015</h2>
							<p>Today we met to discuss the necessary technologies we will have to master in order to complete our project of digitizing the HUAC records. Our workflow currently looks like this:</p>

							<p>We are Digital HUAC, creators of the project that will digitize the HUAC transcripts from 1938 to 1975. We aim to open up the HUAC records by equipping our users with a robust searching functionality, as well as an API for additional data and textual analysis.</p>

					<h2>About the Project</h2>
						<p> The HUAC records, composed of hundreds of hearings and over tens of thousands of pages from 1938-1975, represent one of the most substantive and largest collections of 20<sup>th</sup> century American political and social history. The records provide primary source material on American Cold War history and a unique account of government responses to real and perceived political dissent at key moments in American history.</p>
						<p>Not only do we plan to make these important historical documents available to the public, but we will also provide an interface that will make the documents searchable and usable for research.</p>
						<p>Our project goals include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>extracting full-text from the scanned documents</li>
								<li>XML tagging of the documents</li>
								<li>API development so the user can feed the documents into a topic modeling tool, such as Mallet</li>
							</ul>

			<h3><em>Our Goal</em></h3>
			<p>The purpose of this blog is to record our journey of digitzing one of the largest collections of primary source material on American Cold War history. Our group consists of a librarian, history teacher, doctoral student of criminal justice, and marketer, connected by our shared interest in the using digital humanities methodology to digitize an archive. Through this public space, we will share our workproduct, ongoing discussions on methodology, as well as our progresses and challenges along the way. We hope to serve as a resource for other aspiring digital archivists.</p>
